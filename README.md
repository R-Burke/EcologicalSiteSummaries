Summary Reports using AIM Data
This is a document for R Markdown that knits to HTML a comprehensive summary report of Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) data across ecological sites. 

Copy and paste the code into R Markdown and specify your state, ecological site, and file paths. The rest is automated.

This is a point count report, not a weighted analysis. The weighted analysis cannot be automated. 

Contact the NOC or Jornada if you are interested in a weighted analysis (i.e. percent cover by species per acre)
