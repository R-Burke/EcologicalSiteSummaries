# EcologicalSiteSummaries
Summary Reports using AIM Data
This is a document for R Markdown that knits to HTML a comprehensive summary report of Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) data across ecological sites. 

Follow along this code with the ESS Tool user guide. Copy and paste file paths and specify your ecological site. The rest is automated. 

This is a point count report, not a weighted analysis. The weighted analysis cannot be automated. 

Contact the NOC or Jornada if you are interested in a weighted analysis (i.e. percent cover by species per acre)
