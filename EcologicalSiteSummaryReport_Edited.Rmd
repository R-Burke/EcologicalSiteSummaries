## About Ecological Sites

The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service defines ecological sites a "a distinctive kind of land with specific physical characteristics that differs from other kinds of land in its ability to produce a distinctive kind and amount of vegetation" ([USDAâ€“NRCS, 2006](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/landuse/rangepasture/?cid=stelprdb1068392)). Ecological sites determine not only the ecological potential of a site, but also how a site can respond to natural disturbance and management actions. Ecological sites have been delineated for many areas using physical and biotic features and are often linked to soil map units. Soils, climate, hydrology, geology, physiographic features, plants species occurrences, plant community composition, annual biomass production, and plant-wildlife interactions all contribute to the formation of ecological sites.  Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs) describe the underlying factors associated with a specific ecological site, as well as different ecological states within a given site based on factors such as grazing, fire, drought, and other management actions. For an example of an ESD, see [EDIT Jornada](https://edit.jornada.nmsu.edu/page?content=class-description&catalog=3&spatial=84&class=5802#top-bookmark). \

The overall status of an ecological site can be described with an Ecological Site Summary (ESS). A major data source for developing these summaries is the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring Program. The AIM program includes almost 25,000 plots throughout the western United States (*see* [AIM Data Portal](https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=930fff59dcd1497f87447a655b59747e)). Data garnered from AIM plots is scalable and thus applicable to management decisions at both local and national levels. At the site level, ecological site summaries generated from AIM data can tell us about the condition and health of ecological sites based on indicators such as cover by structure and functional group, species dominance, species occurrences, and canopy gap measurements. The utility of AIM data for the development of more detailed ESDs and ecological state mapping is continually increasing as the program continues to grow. Assigning individual plots or regions ecological states allows us to not only determine the degree of departure from the reference ecological state, but also to inform management and restoration actions accordingly by determining the best pathway to a less degraded state. For more on state and transition models, see [Bestelmeyer et al., 2017](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46709-2_9.pdf). \

Using R and TerrAdat to create these summaries allows them to be continually updated as new data becomes available each year. This information can be included in decision making processess for BLM managers, as it can help inform land use plans, grazing permit renewals, shrub or invasive species treatments, and/or seed menu development for ecological restoration and reclamation. In cases where ESDs are not developed, grouping AIM data by other features can provide similar information, and potentially lead to the development of new ESDs. It may be informative to group by features such as watershed units, soil map units, biophysical settings, or grazing allotments. \

This demo uses data from New Mexico, but is applicable to any state with an available species list. \

##
## Required Inputs 

To generate these reports, several inputs are required. These include your state, your ecological site(s) of interest, and directions to the directories containing raw tables from TerrADat. Tall tables are required for this code. These can be requested from the Jornada, or established using the tidyr::gather() function on the raw tables in R. After directing the tool to the right place and specifying your state and ecological site, these reports are automated. \
*Note: these reports only work with a state species list.*

# 4. Species Cover Summaries <a name = "species"></a> {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

These summaries use data from line point intercept methods to determine average cover of individual species, as well as summaries by structure and functional group cover, noxious versus non-noxious cover, and woody vs. non-woody cover. From the AIM data, we can make some simple graphs showing cover values. These graphs, along with the summary tables, can quickly be incorporated into any documents where this data is used (i.e. NEPA documents for grazing permit renewals, shrub treatments, etc). 

``` {r Species Code , echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

## Trace Species {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

It is unlikely that all species on a plot will be detected in line point intercept. It can be inferred that these species that were never detected in LPI have "low abundance" across this ecological site. To determine all species detected on plots throughout an ecological site (or other grouping feature), we can pull in all species detected from all other methods using the accumulated species indicator. This can give us an idea of overall diversity across the ecological site, indicate seed bank and restoration potential, and inform us more about community composition and species trends as plots are repeatedly surveyed.

# 5. Ground Cover Summaries {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

On top of species-specific indicators, we can summarize ground cover indicators to get percent cover values for bare ground, total rock, total litter, and total foliar. Additional indicators that can be included here are Lichen ("LC") , Moss ("M") , Duff ("D"), and/or Cyanobacteria ("CY"). These calculations are informative for assessing the status of the ecological site as a whole, susceptibility to erosion, and/or cross-walking AIM data to [Rangeland Health Assessments](https://www.landscapetoolbox.org/manuals/iirhv5/) when used in conjunction with species specific calculations.

# 7. Canopy Gap  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Canopy gap intercept can inform us about potential wind erosion, weed invasion, and wildlife habitat. When combined with vegetation height measurements, gap measurements can inform us about vegetation structure (see p. 41 in the [Monitoring Manual](aim.landscapetoolbox.org) for methods). Canopy gap, bare soil, and vegetation heights can also be used to determine thresholds at which vegetation structure may lead to a shift in ecoloogical states.
